## by (Ahmed)


## Dataset

> The dataset reports flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays from 1987 to 2008. Actually, the plan was to gather & analyze data for three years (2006, 2007 & 2008). However it is time consuming to treat the report due to the detaset size which is (21,604,865) observations. Therefore, the report will gather & analyze flights of 2008 which is (7,009,728) observations by resolve the following questions:-
> - what are the best airports/states in terms of delayed and cancelled flighes?
> - what are the best airlines in terms of delayed and cancelled flighes?
> - what are the best flights in terms of delayed and cancelled flighes?
